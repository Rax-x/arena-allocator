# 🏟️ Arena allocator

When I develop toy compilers, I have to deal with data structures allocation and deallocation and it's really painful with C,
to make my life easier I choose arena allocators, because I don't have to deal with memory deallocation and I'm sure
that at some point in the program, all the allocated memory is released. This is the implementation that always I copy
and paste from a project to another.

# 🧪 Testing

At the moment I've implemented only the basic test cases. 
If other test cases come up in your mind, open an issue, and we will discuss it.

To execute the tests, open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
make test
```
